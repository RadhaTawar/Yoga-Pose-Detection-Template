        <h2>(Lotus Pose)</h2>
        <p>Padmasana (Lotus Pose) is both a grounding and energizing pose with powerful symbolism behind it. “A lotus is rooted 
            in the mud, and when it grows, it blooms into a beautiful flower,”. “In the same way, when a person begins yoga, they are rooted in the mud as part of 
            the mundane world. But as they progress, they can grow into a blooming flower.”</p>

        <p>The lotus is often found in Hindu iconography, associated with many powerful deities. Lakshmi (the goddess of abundance) 
            is often shown sitting on an open lotus and holding another in her hand. The same is true of Ganesha, the elephant-headed 
            destroyer of obstacles, and Lord Vishnu, who is said to represent the principle of preservation in the universe. And lore 
            has it that wherever the Buddha walked, lotus flowers bloomed.
        </p>
        <p>
            As important as the lotus flower is in Hindu imagery, Lotus Pose is an important foundational pose in yoga practice. This 
            seated posture boasts many physical and energetic benefits: it can help improve circulation in the lumbar spine, stretch 
            the ankles and legs, and increase flexibility in the hips. “What is unique about Padmasana is that it’s both a grounding 
            and a profoundly expansive pose,” ho has says ParaYoga founder Rod Stryker, wbeen teaching yoga since the late 1980s. “The 
            grounding happens in the body, but energetically it directs our awareness toward the spine and the higher centers.”
        </p>
        <p>Practice the pose to whatever extent your body allows, and don’t get caught up in achieving a “perfect” pose.</p>

    <h5><b>Pose benefits</b></h5>
    <h5>Lotus Pose creates a solid foundation for meditation practices. Settling into the pose activates the relaxation response
         (parasympathetic nervous system) and deactivates the stress response (sympathetic nervous system). Lotus Pose may help 
         lower or regulate blood pressure. Physically, you can count on it to open the hip joints and stretch the front of the 
         thighs (quadriceps), the groin, and the ankles.</h5>
